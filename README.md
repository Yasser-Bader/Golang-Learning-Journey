Welcome to my repository! This creates a documentation of my journey mastering **Go (Golang)** from basics to advanced topics. Every folder here represents a specific concept I have learned or a mini-project I have built to practice.

## 📂 Repository Structure

I organized the code by topics to make it easy to navigate:

| Folder | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01-Basics` | Variables & Syntax | Variables, Constants, Basic Types. |
| `02-ControlFlow` | Logic | If/Else, Switch, For Loops. |
| `03-DataStructures` | Collections | Arrays, Slices, Maps, Structs. |
| `04-Functions` | Modular Code | Functions, Closures, Defer. |
| `05-Concurrency` | Go Power | Goroutines, Channels, WaitGroups. |
| `06-Projects` | Mini Apps | Real-world applications and tools. |

## 🛠️ Mini-Projects Checklist

This list tracks the practical tasks I implement:

- [x] **CLI Calculator**: A simple terminal-based calculator.
- [ ] **Student Management System**: CRUD operations using Structs and Maps.
- [ ] **Concurrency Web Scraper**: Fetching data from multiple URLs simultaneously.
- [ ] **REST API To-Do List**: A backend service using `net/http`.

## 🚀 How to Run

To run any script, navigate to the specific directory and use the `go run` command.

Example:
```bash
cd 01-Basics
go run main.go
